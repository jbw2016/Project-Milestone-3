                I am Blake Wann, a Third Party Risk Analyst that works remotely in north Georgia. I have been working in Information Security for over two years and currently a Junior at Kennesaw State University, seeking a bachelors in Information Technology. Growing up, I always had a great interest in technology growing up and have been continuously learning to develop my technical skills. <br><br>
                I served in the United States Navy for 5 years and was stationed in Jacksonville, Fl in Patrol and Reconnaissance Squadron (VP) 45 as a Aviation Electriciansmate (AE). While in the Navy I completed two deployments, first to Okinawa, Japan and the second to El Salvador and Sigonella, Italy. <br><br>
                I was born in Decatur, Georgia and grew up in a small town called Scottsboro, Alabama. I have been married for almost 12 years and have three amazing children. I am a huge Alabama football fan and I coach youth baseball in the spring and fall. My hobbies include going to the gym and doing anything outdoors including fishing, hiking and camping.
